# Socket.IO Considerations for Vercel Deployment

## Important Note

Vercel serverless functions don't support persistent WebSocket connections. This affects Socket.IO functionality.

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Use a Dedicated WebSocket Service
- **Pusher**: Real-time messaging service
- **Ably**: WebSocket as a service
- **Socket.IO on Railway/Render**: Deploy Socket.IO separately

### Option 2: Polling-based Updates
- Use React Query with polling for real-time-like updates
- Implement server-sent events for notifications

### Option 3: Separate WebSocket Server
- Deploy Socket.IO server on Railway, Render, or DigitalOcean
- Keep REST API on Vercel
- Use environment variable to point to WebSocket server

## Current Implementation

The current Socket.IO code will work in development but needs modification for production.

### Temporary Solution (Current)
The app will function without real-time features on Vercel. Chat and calls will work but without instant updates.

### Production Solution (Recommended)
Deploy the Socket.IO server separately and update the frontend to connect to it.

## Update Required

Add to environment variables:
```
WEBSOCKET_URL=https://your-websocket-server.com
```

Then update frontend to connect to this URL instead of the main API.
